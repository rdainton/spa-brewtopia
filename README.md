# Brewtopia.io SPA, built with Vue 3 & TS.
A simple drag-and-drop driven MTG deckbuilder, letting you craft your brew (unofficially) in the browser.

Currently still in development.

## The tech

This front-end is being developed with Vue 3 and Typescript, in Vite. The project uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

### Getting it going
Simply run `yarn install && yarn dev`, then open the URL `http://localhost:3000/` in a browser to have a play.

Note that without running an instance of the Brewtopia.io API (another repo), you will not be able to log in and make use of decklist save/load features. However, you can still build and deck, and export to `.txt`.
